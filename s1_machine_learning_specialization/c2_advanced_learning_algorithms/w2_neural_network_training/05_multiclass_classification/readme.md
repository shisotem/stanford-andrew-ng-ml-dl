# Multiclass Classification

## Multiclass

- e.g. Classify pictures of pills into categories: scratch, discoloration, chip, etc.

## Softmax

- The **softmax regression** algorithm is a generalization of the logistic regression algorithm.

  - If you apply softmax regression with N equals 2, the parameters end up being a little bit different, but it ends up reducing to the logistic regression model.

- If y is equal to 2, the loss for this example is the negative log of the probability that y was predicted to be 2. (Note: we do not compute the negative log of a<sub>1</sub> or any other terms in this case.)

  - If y = j, the smaller a<sub>j</sub> is, the bigger the loss.
