# Bias and variance

## Diagnosing bias and variance

- The most powerful diagnostic that I know of and that I used for a lot of machine learning applications is one called bias and variance.

## Regularization and bias/variance

## Establishing a baseline level of performance

## Learning curves

## Deciding what to try next revisited

## Bias/variance and neural networks

## Optional Lab: Diagnosing Bias and Variance
