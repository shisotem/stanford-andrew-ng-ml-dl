# Bias and variance

## Diagnosing bias and variance

- The **most powerful diagnostic** that I know of and have used for a lot of machine learning applications, is "bias and variance". This gives you very good guidance on **what to try next**.

## Regularization and bias/variance

## Establishing a baseline level of performance

## Learning curves

## Deciding what to try next revisited

## Bias/variance and neural networks
