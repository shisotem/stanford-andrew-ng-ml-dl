# Overview of Machine Learning

## Welcome to machine learning!

- **machine learning**: the science of getting computers to learn without being explicitly programmed (Arthur Samuel 1959: checkers playing program)

## Applications of machine learning

- **AGI**: Artificial General Intelligence

- I think there could be even vastly greater value that has yet to be created outside the software industry in sectors such as retail, travel, transportation, automotive, materials manufacturing, and so on.
