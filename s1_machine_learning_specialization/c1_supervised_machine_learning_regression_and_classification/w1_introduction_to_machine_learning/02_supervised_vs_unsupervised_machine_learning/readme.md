## Supervised learning part 1

- I think **99 percent** of the economic value created by machine learning today is through one type of machine learning, which is called **supervised learning**.

- Learns from **being given "right answers"**

  | Input (X)         | Output (Y)             | Application         |
  | ----------------- | ---------------------- | ------------------- |
  | email             | spam? (0/1)            | spam filtering      |
  | audio             | text transcripts       | speech recognition  |
  | English           | Japanese               | machine translation |
  | ad, user info     | click? (0/1)           | online advertising  |
  | image, radar info | position of other cars | self-driving car    |
  | image of phone    | defect? (0/1)          | visual inspection   |

- **Regression**: Housing price prediction
