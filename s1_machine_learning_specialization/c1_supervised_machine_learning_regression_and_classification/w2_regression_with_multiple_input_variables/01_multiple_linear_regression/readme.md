- Model of Multiple Linear Regression

  - **Multiple Linear Regression**: This is a type of linear regression that uses **multiple features**.

    - A model with **n features** can be represented as: f<sub>w,b</sub>(**x**) = w<sub>1</sub>**x<sub>1</sub>** + w<sub>2</sub>**x<sub>2</sub>** + ... + w<sub>n</sub>**x<sub>n</sub>** + b

  - Base Price: This refers to the starting price of a house, which is assumed to be $80,000, even if the house has no size, no bedrooms, no floors, and is not of any particular age.

  - (Note: The term "multivariate regression" refers to a different concept that we will not be using here.)
