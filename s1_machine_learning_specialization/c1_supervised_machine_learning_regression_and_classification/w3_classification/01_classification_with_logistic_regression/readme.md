# Classification with logistic regression

## Motivations

- The assignment of true/1 or false/0 is often arbitrary. Often either choice could work. (e.g. non-spam: true/1, spam: false/0)

- What happens when you try to use linear regression for classification? - Often it will **not** work well.

  - For this particular training set, the blue line seems reasonable at first glance.
  - However, just by adding one training example to the right, the linear regression line (and decision boundary) shifts significantly to the right, resulting in a drastic decrease in prediction accuracy.
